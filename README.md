# overall-developer-test

Complete front-end/back-end test. This assessment will test the candidate's ability and resourcefulness 


* This test has two parts:
            1 - A backend (solution including sql Scripts, RESTful API interface using JSON as the output method)
            2 - A frontend. (Using either HTML/CSS/Javascript & Bootstrap or an mvc application)
             
1: The Backend
* Using a Four Square library, hard code into the script a location/s.
* Using the Geo information from this, collect photos from Instagram for this/these locations
* Save the image URL and relevant information (Description etc) into a database.
* Ensure that if the task is run more than once, no duplicates are added to the database.
 
2: The Frontend
* Display the results from the database in a responsive manner (If using HTML output).
* Search the database for images based on the fields you have chosen to save with the image URLs
* Paginate the results limiting results to 10 per page.
 
3: Bonus
* Instead of hard coding the locations in the script/task file, try using the database to store a list of locations.
* To go even further, use a basic authentication:
            - Allow users to create accounts and login.
            - Allow users to edit a list of locations and then display and search only images from that users location list
* Try using a javascript based search (if using HTML output)
* Try using whatever template or custom javascript libraries you like to wow us all (if using HTML output)
