# Technical assessment for backend and frontend developer

## The purpose of the assessment is to test your ability:
### Backend
* to deliver a web API to be consumed by external systems
* design a SQL Server database
* integration with other external APIs
### Frontend 
* build a front end using HTML and CSS using responsive design
* use JavaScript efficiently
* integration with external APIs using JavaScript


## Please use the following tools as part of your solution:
* HTML(5)
* CSS(3) and/or Bootstrap
* JavaScript, jQuery, EmberJS, AngularJS, Knockout



##1: The Backend
* Using a Four Square library, hard code into the script a location/s.
* Using the Geo information from this, collect photos from Instagram for this/these locations
* Save the image URL and relevant information (Description etc) into a database.
* Ensure that if the task is run more than once, no duplicates are added to the database.
 
2: The Frontend
* Display the results from the database in a responsive manner (If using HTML output).
* Search the database for images based on the fields you have chosen to save with the image URLs
* Paginate the results limiting results to 10 per page.
 
3: Bonus
* Instead of hard coding the locations in the script/task file, try using the database to store a list of locations.
* To go even further, use a basic authentication:
            - Allow users to create accounts and login.
            - Allow users to edit a list of locations and then display and search only images from that users location list
* Try using a javascript based search (if using HTML output)
* Try using whatever template or custom javascript libraries you like to wow us all (if using HTML output)
